# What is this?

This repository is a fork of [a machine learning(ML) model made by UCSD](https://github.com/UCSD-AI4H/COVID-CT).
**Our goal is to create a reliable ML model that can determine if a patient has COVID-19 based on computed tomography(CT) scans from a sample of patients that have tested positive and patients that have tested negative.**
